OpenGL-Solar-System
===================

This is a small representation using OpenGL of a Solar System with: Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, a comet and some planet's satellites. Created in 2010.


You can increase / decrease the rotation and translation speed by pressing the ↑ and ↓ keys.


IMPORTANT:
----------

To see the textures when you run the Xcode project, I you should copy the images that you find in the folder "Textures" in the folder in which is the executable when you build it (only the images). And then, run it.

or

In the "Downloads" section in GitHub, you can download the executable for Mac OS. If you want to run the executable outside the project, I recommend to open a Terminal and go to the folder in which is the executable and the images. And then you can run the executables. 


Otherwise the textures will not appear :/ Sorry about that.


Hope this is helpful! Enjoy.
